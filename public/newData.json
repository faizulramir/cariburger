They cooked it according to my preference, got medium rare so it was still soft and juicy.

My family and I came to Putrajaya\\u2019s branch today (19th February 2023) for lunch and it is our first time here. We made the reservation earlier for eight (8) people to avoid queuing.\\n\\nThe food tasted okay and the price was reasonable. However, the food quality was bad, maybe because the chef did not properly check the food before being served.\\n\\n1) The FRIES (appetizers) were SERVED LATE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MAIN COURSE and the fries were SOGGY.\\n\\n2) The APPETIZERS WERE SERVED ON KIDDIES\\u2019 PLATES (similar to Ikea plastic) when it was not listed under the kid's menu in the first place (see photo)\\n\\n3) We ordered the YOUYO MELTIQUE BEEF to be a MEDIUM COOK BUT TURNED OUT to be MEDIUM RARE.\\n\\n4) The GRILLED DISHES that we ordered (Striploin Steak, Grilled Chicken, Mixed Grilled & Youyo Meltique Beef) WERE NOT NEWLY GRILLED but reheat maybe, yet BARELY WARM.\\n\\n5) The GRILLED CHICKEN was also DRY.\\n\\n6) The brown sauce that was served with the grilled dishes - was COLD.\\n\\n7) The BUTTERMILK CHICKEN was also COLD. Served with soup, but the SOUP WAS COLD UNTIL YOU CAN SEE THE FAT THAT ALREADY SET FLOATING IN THE SOUP.\\n\\n8) THE ROASTED POTATOES WERE COLD & SOGGY. It is like they were cooked and baked yesterday and reheated before being served, yet they are BARELY WARM.\\n\\n9) I ORDERED A LATTE (as stated in the menu book), but unfortunately, it DID NOT TASTE LIKE A LATTE at all but like a Kopiko candy. So, I asked the staff what is this and the staff proudly answered, \\u201cWE USE INSTANT COFFEE\\u201d. (I think you should not mention it as a latte in your menu book, better put it as \\u201cInstant Coffee\\u201d and charge it accordingly).\\n\\n10) The BLUEBERRY CHEESE WAFFLE turned out to be like a BLUEBERRY JAM BEING DUMPED ON THE WAFFLE together with a scoop of ice cream or cheese (not sure) and oreo-crumb (see photo)\\n\\n11) The ICE CREAM on top of the BANANA SPLIT CARAMEL WAFFLE WAS CRYSTALLIZED (has already melted and is re-freeze)\\n\\nI gave it 1 star because one of the waffles ordered was well-presented and had great taste (see photo).\\nWe did not bother to take many photos as we were not excited to do so (because of the food quality).\\nIt was just an honest review.
